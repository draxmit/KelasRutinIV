On this session I have learnt:

* The basics of Solidity
* How to deploy and transact contracts on Lisk Testnet
* Logics can be implemented on the contracts



One significant challenge I faced is when i tried to transact PlantSeed function through the contract explorer, it is quite confusing on how to set the transaction value. When I set it to be low, somehow the gas fee is more expensive. Although it got resolved, and I managed to get it tested all good.



I hope to explore more on what can be done on chain.
